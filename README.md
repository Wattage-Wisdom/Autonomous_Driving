Final project for ETLS699: AI, Robotics and Autonomous Systems.
Project was developed for turtlebot3 Waffle using ROS2 Foxy distribution.
Proper implementation of this repository enables autonomous driving on a
pre-generated map with obstacle aviodance. Stoplight detection has also
been added through a convolutional neural network implemented in tensorflow
and trained from images aquired from the on board turtlebot3 raspi camera.
